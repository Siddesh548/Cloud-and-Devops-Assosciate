**Topic: Logs & Filters**
**Tools Required:** Linux Terminal, grep, awk
**Task Description:**
A caching experiment filled system logs with stale object eviction notices. Trainers want these particular eviction warnings extracted to demonstrate cache invalidation mechanisms.

**Expected Output:**
Submit a file named s18_q5_eviction.txt containing only the filtered eviction log entries.

**Tools Used**

Redis — To simulate cache eviction
grep — To filter eviction logs
awk — To format extracted data
Linux Terminal — To run commands & view logs

**Installing Redis**

sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server -y


**Enable and start Redis**

sudo systemctl enable redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server

**Running the Script**

chmod +x evict.sh
bash evict.sh
